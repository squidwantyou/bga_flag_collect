We discourage you to continue to use BGA, but if you do be careful to NEVER violate the Terms again.</li><li>You should have received in the past emails from our moderators explaning why you've been reported (please check the emails <u>associated to your BGA account</u>, including your spam box). The only possible way to contest all of this is to follow the procedure described in these emails. <b>We do not provide ANY answer</b> when the procedure is not properly followed.</li><li>Note: Our system also regularly and automatically blocks networks that cause too many moderation reports. In any case, if you ever received an email from our moderators, the reason of this ban is probably in this email.</li></ul><br/><b>If you are NOT the author of the violations:</b><ul><li>You are now informed that someone is using this connection to violate our Terms.</li><li>We are truly sorry for the situation.</li><li>Please note that it many countries, the owner of an internet connection used to infringe the law may be liable for prosecution.</li><li>Consequently, we recommend you to find out who violated our Terms and to take measures to stop this person from infringing again, otherwise there is a high risk that his/her attitude will force us to block other networks you are using or are responsible for.</li><li>There is no use in contacting us to ask for details: all the necessary details have been sent directly to the concerned player by email, and only this person can contest the decision.</li></ul></div></b><br/><br/><a href='/'>>> Get me out of here <<</a><br/><br/><span id='bga_fatal_error_code' style='display:none;'>100</span></div>
